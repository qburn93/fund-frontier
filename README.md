<h1 align="center">Fund Frontier</h1>

Welcome to Fund Frontier, a NPV Calculator designed to empower users in making informed investment decisions. This program facilitates the evaluation of the Net Present Value (NPV) for up to three projects simultaneously, enabling a comprehensive analysis of their financial viability. The Net Present Value, a crucial financial metric, considers the time value of money to assess the profitability of an investment by calculating the present value of future cash flows.
